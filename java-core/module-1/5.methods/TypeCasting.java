	types of type casting : 
		1. primitive typecasting
		2. non primitive typecasting

	1. primitive typecasting : The conversion of one primitive datatype
	into another primitive datatype is known as primitive typecasting.
		Types: 
			1. Widening
				The conversion of smaller datatype into bigger datatype
				it is also known as implicit typecasting.
				
				flow: 
				byte -> short-> int -> long -> float -> double
				char -> int -> long -> float -> doublex`
				
			2. Narrowing
			 	The conversion of bigger datatype into smaller datatype
				It is also known as explicit typecasting because to perform 
				narrowing we need typecast opertator.
				During narrowing data loss can be happens.
				
				
	2. non primitive typecasting : The conversion of one non primitive
	datatype into another nonprimitive datatype is known non primitive 
	typecasting.
		Types: 
			1. Upcasting :
				Conversion of subclass to superclass
			2. Downcasting
				Conversion superclass to subclass */
